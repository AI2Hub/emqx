##--------------------------------------------------------------------
## RPC With TCP
## See rpc-with-ssl.conf.example for RPC with SSL
## EMQX inter-broker communication
##--------------------------------------------------------------------
## Note: This is an example of how to configure this feature
##       you should copy and paste the below data into the emqx.conf for working

## Note: Most of the time the default config should work
##   you do not need to modify it unless you know what it is for
rpc {
    ## Communication mode
    ## Type: sync | async
    mode = async

    ## Transport protocol used for inter-broker communication
    ## Type: tcp | ssl
    protocol = tcp

    ## The maximum number of batch messages sent in asynchronous mode
    ## Type: Integer
    async_batch_size = 256

    ## Port discovery strategy
    ## Type:
    ##   - manual :: discover ports by tcp_server_port
    ##   - stateless :: discover ports in a stateless manner, using the following algorithm:
    ##       If node name is emqxN@127.0.0.1, where the N is an integer, then the listening port will be 5370 + N
    port_discovery = stateless

    ## Listening port used by RPC local service
    tcp_server_port = 5369

    ## Set the maximum number of RPC communication channels initiated by this node to each remote node
    ## Type: Range from 1 to 256
    tcp_client_num = 10

    ## Timeout for establishing an RPC connection
    connect_timeout = 5s

    ## Timeout for sending the RPC request
    send_timeout = 5s

    ## Timeout for the remote node authentication
    authentication_timeout = 5s

    ## Timeout for the reply to a synchronous RPC
    call_receive_timeout = 15s

    ## How long the connections between the brokers should remain open after the last message is sent
    socket_keepalive_idle = 15m

    ## The interval between keepalive messages
    socket_keepalive_interval = 75s

    ## How many times the keepalive probe message can fail to receive a reply until the RPC connection is considered lost
    socket_keepalive_count = 9

    ## TCP sending buffer size
    socket_sndbuf = 1MB

    ## TCP receiving buffer size
    socket_recbuf = 1MB

    ## Socket buffer size in user mode
    socket_buffer = 1MB
