# Examples

Here are examples of how to configure features In EMQX,  most of them can be used directly by copy-paste content into the `emqx.conf` file, others may need to be slightly modified to use, for example, you should change the listener port or HTTP URL to what you actually used.

Although we have tried to show every configurable field in the example,
you do not need to care about each one, since most of them already have default values and can be omitted in the configuration file.

If you are confused about some fields, please refer to our documents, here are just some simple configuration examples with necessary descriptions.
