## configuring for current EMQX node
##--------------------------------------------------------------------
## Note: This is an example of how to configure this feature
##       you should copy and paste the below data into the emqx.conf for working

## Note: all fields in this section are immutable after EMQX started, and most of the time you only need to modify the value for the name and cookie.
node {
    ## The actions triggered when the alarm is activated
    ## Type: Formatted String
    ##   Format: any_name@any_domain or an_name@any_ip
    ##   Note: Make sure the IP resolve from the domain is deterministic and unique and never change
    name = "emqx@127.0.0.1"

    ## Secret cookie is a random string that should be the same on all nodes in the given EMQX cluster, but unique per EMQX cluster
    cookie = "Yzc0NGExM2RjYzYxYzM0YzQ5MWQ0NmI1NWM0MWRhMzY4NzgxYmFkMmI2MWJjZWQ5NTQzYTMxNjE1ODVmYmJmMyAgLQo="

    ## Select a node role
    ## Type:
    ##   - core :: nodes provide durability of the data, and take care of writes
    ##   - replicant :: nodes are ephemeral worker nodes
    role = core

    ## Maximum number of simultaneously existing processes for this Erlang system
    ## Type: Range from 1024 to 134217727
    process_limit = 2097152

    ## Maximum number of simultaneously existing ports for this Erlang system
    ## Type: Range from 1024 to 134217727
    max_ports = 1048576

    ## Erlang's distribution buffer busy limit in kilobytes
    ## Type: Range from 1 to 2097152
    dist_buffer_size = 8192

    ## Path to the persistent data directory
    data_dir = "var/emqx/data"

    ## Type: Periodic garbage collection interval
    global_gc_interval = 15m
