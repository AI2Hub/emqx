Fix the problem that sending messages to data-bridges failed because of incorrect handling of some data-bridges without `local_topic` field configured.
Before this change, if some bridges have configured the `local_topic` field but others have not, a `function_clause` error will occur when forwarding messages to the data-bridges.
