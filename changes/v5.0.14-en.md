# v5.0.14

## Enhancements

- Make possible to configure `host:port` from environment variables without quotes [#9614](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/9614).
  Prior to this change, when overriding a `host:port` config value from environment variable, one has to quote it as:
  `env EMQX_BRIDGES__MQTT__XYZ__SERVER='"localhost:1883"'`.
  Now it's possible to set it without quote as `env EMQX_BRIDGES__MQTT__XYZ__SERVER='localhost:1883'`.

- Obfuscated sensitive data in the response when querying `bridges` information by API [#9593](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/9593/).

- Made rule engine behavior more consistent with bridge behavior regarding metrics: if a rule engine is disabled, its metrics are now reset []().

## Bug Fixes

- Fix an issue where testing the GCP PubSub could leak memory, and an issue where its JWT token would fail to refresh a second time. [#9641](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/9641)

- Fix the problem of data loss and bad match when the MySQL driver is disconnected [#9638](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/9638).

- Fixed an issue where changing the storage type of the built-in database retainer would not take effect without restarting the node [#9676](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/9676).
