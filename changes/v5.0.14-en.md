# v5.0.14

## Enhancements

- Make possible to configure `host:port` from environment variables without quotes [#9614](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/9614).
  Prior to this change, when overriding a `host:port` config value from environment variable, one has to quote it as:
  `env EMQX_BRIDGES__MQTT__XYZ__SERVER='"localhost:1883"'`.
  Now it's possible to set it without quote as `env EMQX_BRIDGES__MQTT__XYZ__SERVER='localhost:1883'`.

## Bug Fixes

- Fix an issue where testing the GCP PubSub could leak memory, and an issue where its JWT token would fail to refresh a second time. [#9641](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/9641)
