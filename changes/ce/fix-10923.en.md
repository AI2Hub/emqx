Fix a race-condition in channel info registration.

Prior to this fix, when system is under heavy load, it might happen that a client is disconnected (or has its session expired) but still can be found in the clients page in dashboard.
One of the possible reasons is a race condition fixed in this PR: the connection is killed in the middle of channel data registration.
