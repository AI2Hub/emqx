Disallow using multiple TLS versions in the listener config that include tlsv1.3 but exclude tlsv1.2.

Using TLS configuration with such version gap caused connection errors.
Additionally, drop and log TLS options that are incompatible with the selected TLS version(s).

Note: any old listener configuration with the version gap described above will fail to load
after applying this fix and must be manually fixed.
