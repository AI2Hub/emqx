In case the cluster updated license before the new node join in. The new node will not apply the updated license.
After this change, the new joined node will use the cluster's license key.

Sometimes the new node must start with a outdated license.
e.g. use emqx-operator deployed and needed to scale up after license expired.
At the time the cluster's license key already updated by API/CLI, but the new node won't use it.
