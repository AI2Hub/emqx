Allow 'enable' as well as 'enabled' as the state flag for listeners.

Prior to this change, listener can be enable/disabled by setting the 'true' or 'false' on the 'enabled' config.
This is slightly different naming comparing to other state flags in the system.
No the 'enable' flag is added as an aliase on listeners.
