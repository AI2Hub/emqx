Improve daemon mode startup failure logs.

Before this change, it was difficult for users to understand the reason for EMQX 'start' command failed to boot the node.
The only information they received was that the node did not start within the expected time frame,
and they were instructed to boot the node with 'console' command in the hope of obtaining some logs.
However, the node might actually be running, which could cause 'console' mode to fail for a different reason.

With this new change, when daemon mode fails to boot, a diagnosis is issued. Here are the possible scenarios:

* If the node cannot be found from `ps -ef`, the user is instructed to find information in log files `erlang.log.*`.
* If the node is found to be running but not responding to pings, the user is advised to check if the host name is resolvable and reachable.
* If the node is responding to pings, but the EMQX app is not running, it is likely a bug. In this case, the user is advised to report a Github issue.
