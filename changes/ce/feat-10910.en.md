The data bridge resource option `auto_restart_interval` was deprecated in favor of `health_check_interval`, and `request_timeout` was renamed to `request_ttl`.  Also, the default `request_ttl` value went from 15 seconds to 45 seconds.

The previous existence of both `auto_restart_interval` and `health_check_interval` was a source of confusion, as both parameters influenced the recovery of data bridges under failures.  An inconsistent configuration of those two parameters could lead to messages being expired without a chance to retry.  Now, `health_check_interval` is used both to control the periodicity of health checks that may transition the data bridge into `disconnected` or `connecting` states, as well as recovering from `disconnected`.
