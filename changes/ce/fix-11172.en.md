Fix the `payload` will be duplicated in the below situations:
- Use a `foreach` sentence without  the `as` sub-expression and select all fields(use the `*` or omitted the `do` sub-expression)

  For example:

  `FOREACH payload.sensors FROM "t/#"`
- Select the `payload` field and all fields

  For example:

  `SELECT payload.sensors, * FROM "t/#"`
