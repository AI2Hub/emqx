Enhanced the `authentication/:id/import_users` interface for a more user-friendly user import feature:

- Add new query parameter `type=plain` to support importing users with plaintext passwords,
  not just hashed ciphertext passwords.
- Support `content-type: application/json` to accept HTTP Body in JSON format, not just file.
