Fix a compatibility issue of limiter configuration introduced by v5.0.23 which broke the upgrade from previous versions if the `capacity` is `infinity`. 

Since v5.0.23, we had instead of `capacity` by `burst`, after this fix, a `capacity` with `infinity` value will be converted to a `burst` with a zero value.
