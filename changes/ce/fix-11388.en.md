Increase `emqx_router_sup` restart intensity.

The goal is to tolerate occasional crashes that can happen under relatively normal conditions
and don't seem critical to shutdown the whole app (emqx).
For example, mria write/delete call delegated from a replicant to a core node by `emqx_router_helper` may fail,
if the core node is being stopped / restarted / not ready.
