1. Changes in configuration priority:
   For new EMQX installations, configuration priority is `ENV > emqx.conf > HTTP API`.
   For upgrades from an older version with cluster-override.conf, configuration priority remains the same: `HTTP API > ENV > emqx.conf`.
2. Deprecation of `data/configs/local-override.conf`.
3. Simplified configuration items, hidden some advanced items
   The hidden configurations include: exhook,rewrite,topic_metric,persistent_session_store,overload_protection,
   flapping_detect,conn_congestion,stats,auto_subscribe,broker_perf,rule_engine,bridge,shared_subscription_group,slow_subs
   ssl_options.user_lookup_fun and some advance items in node/dashboard.
4. This hidden update doesn't change the functionality of the original configuration,
   but it sets the stage for an improved presentation of configuration documentation in future versions.
