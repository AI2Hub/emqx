Lower default `active_n` value from `100` to `10`.

This change improves the responsiveness of MQTT clients to control signals, particularly when publishing at high rates with small messages.

The new `active_n` value of `10` is set deliberately lower than the default Receive-Maximum (`32`), to introduce more push-back at the TCP layer in the following scenarios:

- The MQTT client process is blocked while performing external authorization checks.
- The MQTT client process is blocked during data integration message sends.
- EMQX is experiencing overload conditions.

Performance testing showed no significant increase in latency across various scenarios (one-to-one, fan-in, and fan-out) on 8-core, 16GB memory nodes.
However, on 2-core, 4GB memory nodes, the baseline latency (with active_n = `100`) was already in the higher 3-digit range with high CPU utilization.
The decision to lower `active_n` optimizes for more common use cases where system stablity takes precedence over latency (in smaller instances).
