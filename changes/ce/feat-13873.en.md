Improve `/api/v5/monitor` endpoint performance.

Prior to this enhancement, the dashboard monitor page often timeout when there are many nodes in the cluster.
Below are detailed changes:

- Make concurrent RPC calls towards nodes in the cluster to retrieve metrics.
- Data points are downsampled to reduce dencity.
  Dencity is adjusted according to the requested time span in the query:
  - `10s` when query the last `1h`
  - `1m` when query the last `1d`
  - `5m` when query the last `3d`
  - `10m` when query the last `7d`
- Insert dummy data points for gaps in the timeline (if EMQX has stopped for a while), so the gap will be visible in the dashboard.
