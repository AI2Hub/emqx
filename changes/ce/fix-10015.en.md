To prevent errors caused by an incorrect EMQX node cookie provided from an environment variable,
we have implemented a fail-fast mechanism.
Previously, when an incorrect cookie was provided, the command would still attempt to ping the node,
leading to the error message 'Node xxx not responding to pings'.
With the new implementation, if a mismatched cookie is detected,
a message will be logged to indicate that the cookie is incorrect,
and the command will terminate with an error code of 1 without trying to ping the node.
