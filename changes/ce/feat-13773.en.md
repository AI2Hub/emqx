Disabled rule actions now no trigger emits `out_of_service` warning.

Previously, if an action is disabled, there would be a warning log with `msg: out_of_service`,
and the `actions.failed` counter is incremented for the rule.

After this enhancement, disabled action will result in a `debug` level log with `msg: discarded`,
and the newly introduced counter `actions.discarded` will be incremented.
