# v4.4.17

## Enhancements

- Remove the error logs from the listeners with `Proxy Protocol` enabled when receiving TCP port probes [emqx/esockd#172](https://github.com/emqx/esockd/pull/172).

  Before this change, if the listener has enabled the Proxy Protocol (`listener.tcp.external.proxy_protocol=on`),
  and if the connection get disconnected right after the TCP handshake is completed and before the ProxyInfo is received, the following error log will be printed:
  ```
  [error] supervisor: 'esockd_connection_sup - <0.3265.0>', errorContext: connection_shutdown, reason: {recv_proxy_info_error,tcp_closed}, offender:
  ```
  After this change, no logs will be printed, but you can still view the statistics of error causes by using the `emqx_ctl listeners` command.

- Improve the logs when the listener experiences file descriptor exhaustion errors [emqx/esockd#173](https://github.com/emqx/esockd/pull/173).
  Previous log messages:
  ```
  [error] Accept error on 0.0.0.0:1883: emfile
  ```
  Log messages after this change:
  ```
  [error] Accept error on 0.0.0.0:1883: EMFILE (Too many open files)
  ```
