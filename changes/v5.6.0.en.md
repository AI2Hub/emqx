# v5.6.0

## Enhancements

- [#12251](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/12251) Optimize performance of the RocksDB-based persistent session.
  Reduce RAM usage and frequency of database requests.

  - Introduce dirty session state to avoid frequent mria transactions
  - Introduce an intermediate buffer for the persistent messages
  - Use separate tracks of PacketIds for QoS1 and QoS2 messages
  - Limit the number of continuous ranges of inflight messages to one per stream

- [#12326](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/12326) Add session registration history.

  Setting config `broker.session_history_retain` allows EMQX to keep track of expired sessions for the retained period.

  API `GET /api/v5/sessions_count?since=1705682238` can be called to count the cluster-wide sessions which were alive (unexpired) since the provided timestamp (UNIX epoch at seconds precision).

  A new gauge `cluster_sessions` is added to the metrics collection. Exposed to prometheus as

  ```
  # TYPE emqx_cluster_sessions_count gauge
  emqx_cluster_sessions_count 1234
  ```

  NOTE: The counter can only be used for an approximate estimation as the collection and calculations are async.

- [#12338](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/12338) Added time-based message garbage collection to the RocksDB-based persistent session backend.

- [#12398](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/12398) Exposed the `swagger_support` option in configuration for Dashboard to disable the swagger API document.

- [#12467](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/12467) Support cluster discovery using AAAA DNS record type.

- [#12483](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/12483) Renamed `emqx ctl conf cluster_sync tnxid ID` to `emqx ctl conf cluster_sync inspect ID`.
  For backward compatibility, `tnxid` is kept, but considered deprecated and will be removed in 5.7.

- [#12499](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/12499) Added ability to ban clients by extended rules:
  * by matching `clientid`s to a regular expression;
  * by matching client's `username` to a regular expression;
  * by matching client's peer address to an CIDR range.

  Warning: large number of matching rules (not tied to a concrete clientid, username or host) will impact performance.

- [#12509](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/12509) Implement API to re-order all authenticators / authorization sources.

- [#12517](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/12517) Congifuration files now support multi-line string values with indentation.

  Introduced the `"""~` and `~"""` to quote indented lines. For example:

  ```
  rule_xlu4 {
  sql = """~
  SELECT
  *
  FROM
  "t/#"
  ~"""
  }
  ```
  See [HOCON 0.42.0](https://github.com/emqx/hocon/releases/tag/0.42.0) release notes for more details.

- [#12520](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/12520) Implement log throttling. The feature reduces the number of potentially flooding logged events by
  dropping all but the first event within a configured time window.
  Throttling is applied to the following log events:
  - `authentication_failure`
  - `authorization_permission_denied`
  - `cannot_publish_to_topic_due_to_not_authorized`
  - `cannot_publish_to_topic_due_to_quota_exceeded`
  - `connection_rejected_due_to_license_limit_reached`
  - `dropped_msg_due_to_mqueue_is_full`

- [#12561](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/12561) Implement HTTP APIs to get the list of client's in-flight and mqueue messages.

  To get the first chunk of data:
  - `GET /clients/{clientid}/mqueue_messages?limit=100`
  - `GET /clients/{clientid}/inflight_messages?limit=100`

  Alternatively:
  - `GET /clients/{clientid}/mqueue_messages?limit=100&position=none`
  - `GET /clients/{clientid}/inflight_messages?limit=100&position=none`

  To get the next chunk of data:
  - `GET /clients/{clientid}/mqueue_messages?limit=100&position={position}`
  - `GET /clients/{clientid}/inflight_messages?limit=100&position={position}`

  Where `{position}` is a value (opaque string token) of `meta.position` field from the previous response.

  Mqueue messages are ordered according to their priority and queue (FIFO) order: from higher priority to lower priority.
  By default, all messages in Mqueue have the same priority of 0.

  In-flight messages are ordered by time at which they were inserted to the in-flight storage (from older to newer messages).

- [#12590](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/12590) Removed `mfa` meta data from log messages to improve clarity.

- [#12641](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/12641) Improve text log formatter fields order.

  `tag` > `clientid` > `msg` > `peername` > `username` > `topic` > [other fields]

- [#12670](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/12670) Add field `shared_subscriptions` to endpoint `/monitor_current` and `/monitor_current/nodes/:node`.

- [#12679](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/12679) Upgrade docker image base from Debian 11 to Debian 12

- [#12700](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/12700) Support "b" and "B" unit in bytesize hocon fields.

  For example, all three fields below will have the value of 1024 bytes:

  ```
  bytesize_field = "1024b"
  bytesize_field2 = "1024B"
  bytesize_field2 = 1024
  ```

- [#12719](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/12719) Support multiple clientid and username Query string parameters in `/clients` API, and make it possible to specify which client info fields must be included in the response.

  Multi clientid/username queries examples:
  - `/clients?clientid=client1&clientid=client2`
  - `/clients?username=user11&username=user2`
  - `/clients?clientid=client1&clientid=client2&username=user1&username=user2`

  Selecting which fields to include in response examples:
  - `/clients?fields=all` (omitting `fields` query string parameter defaults to returning all fields)
  - `/clients?fields=clientid,username`

- [#12381](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/12381) Added new SQL functions: `map_keys()`, `map_values()`, `map_to_entries()`, `join_to_string()`, `join_to_string()`, `join_to_sql_values_string()`, `is_null_var()`, `is_not_null_var()`.

  For more information on the functions and their usage, refer to the documentation.

- [#12336](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/12336) Isolate channels cleanup from other async tasks (like routes cleanup) by using a dedicated pool,
  as this task can be quite slow under high network latency conditions.

- [#12746](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/12746) Add `username` log field.

  If MQTT client is connected with a non-empty username the logs and traces will include `username` field.

## Bug Fixes

- [#11868](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/11868) Fix a bug when will message was not published after session takeover.

- [#12347](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/12347) Always render valid messages for egress MQTT data bridge from the data fetched by Rule SQL, even if the data is incomplete and placeholders used in the bridge configuration are missing.
  Previously, some messages were rendered as invalid and were discarded by the MQTT egress data bridge.

  Render undefined variables as empty strings in `payload` and `topic` templates of the MQTT egress data bridge. Previously, undefined variables were rendered as `undefined` strings.

- [#12472](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/12472) Fixed an issue that could lead to some read operations on `/api/v5/actions/` and `/api/v5/sources/` to return 500 while rolling upgrades are underway.

- [#12492](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/12492) Return `Receive-Maximum` in `CONNACK` for MQTT v5 clients.

  EMQX takes the min value of client's `Receive-Maximum` and server's `max_inflight` config as the max number of inflight (unacknowledged) messages allowed.
  Prior to this fix, the value was not sent back to the client in `CONNACK` message.

- [#12500](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/12500) Now disconnected persistent sessions are returned in the `GET /clients` and `GET /client/:clientid` HTTP APIs.

  Known issue: the total count returned by this API may overestimate the total number of clients.

- [#12513](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/12513) Change level of several flooding log events from warning to info.

- [#12530](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/12530) Enhanced `frame_too_large` and malformed CONNECT packet parse failures to include more information to help troubleshooting.

- [#12541](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/12541) Added a config validation to check if `node.name` is compatible with `cluster.discover_strategy`.

  For `dns` strategy with `a` or `aaaa` record types, all nodes must use (static) IP address as host name.

- [#12562](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/12562) Add a new configuration root: `durable_storage`.

  This configuration tree contains the settings related to the new persistent session feature.

- [#12566](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/12566) Enhanced the bootstrap file for REST API keys:

  - now the empty line will be skipped instead of throwing an error

  - keys from bootstrap file now have highest priority, if one of them conflicts with an old key, the old key will be deleted

- [#12646](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/12646) Fix rule engine date time string parser.

  Prior to this fix, time zone shift can only work when date time string is at second level precision.

- [#12652](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/12652) The subbits functions with 4 and 5 parameters are documented but did not exist in the implementation. These functions have now been added.

- [#12663](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/12663) Fixed an issue where `emqx_vm_cpu_use` and `emqx_vm_cpu_idle` metrics in Prometheus endpoint `/prometheus/stats` are always calculating average usage since operating system boot.

- [#12668](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/12668) Refactor the SQL function: `date_to_unix_ts()` by using `calendar:datetime_to_gregorian_seconds/1`.
  This change also added validation for the input date format.

- [#12672](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/12672) Load `{data_dir}/configs/cluster.hocon` when generating node boot config.

  Logging related config changes made from the dashboard are persisted in `{data_dir}/configs/cluster.hocon`.
  Prior to this change, it only takes `etc/emqx.conf` to generate the boot config (including the logger part),
  then `{data_dir}/configs/cluster.hocon` is loaded to reconfigure the logger after boot is complete.

  This late reconfigure may cause some log segment files to be lost.

  Now `{data_dir}/configs/cluster.hocon` and `etc/emqx.conf` are both loaded (`emqx.conf` overlaying on top)
  to generate boot config.

- [#12696](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/12696) Fixed an issue where attempting to reconnect an action or source could lead to the wrong error message being returned in the HTTP API.

- [#12714](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/12714) Fixed some field errors in prometheus api `/prometheus/stats`.

  Related metrics names:
  - `emqx_cluster_sessions_count`
  - `emqx_cluster_sessions_max`
  - `emqx_cluster_nodes_running`
  - `emqx_cluster_nodes_stopped`
  - `emqx_subscriptions_shared_count`
  - `emqx_subscriptions_shared_max`

  Fixed the issue in endpoint: `/stats` that the values of fields `subscriptions.shared.count` and `subscriptions.shared.max`
  can not be updated in time when the client disconnected or unsubscribed the Shared-Subscription.

- [#12715](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/12715) Fixed an issue when configuration update could crash if connector for corresponding ingress data integration source has active channels.

- [#12740](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/12740) Fixed an issue when durable session could not be kicked out.

## Breaking Changes

- [#12576](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/12576) Starting from 5.6, the "Configuration Manual" document will no longer include the `bridges` config root.

  A `bridge` is now either `action` + `connector` for egress data integration, or `source` + `connector` for ingress data integration.
  Please note that the `bridges` config (in `cluster.hocon`) and the REST API path `api/v5/bridges` still works, but considered deprecated.

- [#12634](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/12634) Triple-quote string values in HOCON config files no longer support escape sequence.

  The detailed information can be found in [this pull request](https://github.com/emqx/hocon/pull/290).
  Here is a summary for the impact on EMQX users:

  - EMQX 5.6 is the first version to generate triple-quote strings in `cluster.hocon`,
  meaning for generated configs, there is no compatibility issue.
  - For user hand-crafted configs (such as `emqx.conf`) a thorough review is needed
  to inspect if escape sequences are used (such as `\n`, `\r`, `\t` and `\\`), if yes,
  such strings should be changed to regular quotes (one pair of `"`) instead of triple-quotes.
