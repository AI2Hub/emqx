# e5.0.3

## Enhancements

- [#10077](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/10077) Add support for QUIC TLS password protected certificate file.


- [#10128](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/10128) Add support for OCSP stapling for SSL MQTT listeners.

- [#10156](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/10156) Change the priority of the configuration:
  1. If it is a new installation of EMQX, the priority of configuration is `ENV > emqx.conf > HTTP API`.
  2. If EMQX is upgraded from an old version (i.e., the cluster-override.conf file still exists in EMQX's data directory), then the configuration priority remains the same as before. That is, `HTTP API > ENV > emqx.conf`.

  Deprecated data/configs/local-override.conf.

  Stabilizing the HTTP API for hot updates.

- [#10164](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/10164) Add CRL check support for TLS MQTT listeners.

- [#10206](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/10206) Decouple the query mode from the underlying call mode for buffer
  workers.

  Prior to this change, setting the query mode of a resource
  such as a bridge to `sync` would force the buffer to call the
  underlying connector in a synchronous way, even if it supports async
  calls.

- [#10207](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/10207) Use 'label' from i18n file as 'summary' in OpenAPI spec.

- [#10210](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/10210) Unregister Mnesia post commit hook when Mria is being stopped.
  This fixes hook failures occasionally occurring on stopping/restarting Mria.

  [Mria PR](https://github.com/emqx/mria/pull/133)

- [#10224](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/10224) Add the option to customize `clusterIP` in Helm chart, so that a user may set it to a fixed IP.

- [#10263](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/10263) Add command 'eval-ex' for Elixir expression evaluation.

- [#10278](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/10278) Refactor the directory structure of all gateways.

- [#10306](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/10306) Add support for `async` query mode for most bridges.

  Before this change, some bridges (Cassandra, MongoDB, MySQL, Postgres, Redis, RocketMQ, TDengine) were only allowed to be created with a `sync` query mode.

- [#10318](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/10318) Now, the rule engine language's FROM clause supports both strings enclosed in double quotes (") and single quotes (').

- [#10336](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/10336) Add `/rule_engine` API endpoint to manage configuration of rule engine.

- [#10354](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/10354) More specific error messages when configure with bad max_heap_size value.
  Log current value and the max value when the `message_queue_too_long` error is thrown.

- [#10358](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/10358) Hide `flapping_detect/conn_congestion/stats` configuration.
  Deprecate `flapping_detect.enable`.

- [#10359](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/10359) Metrics now are not implicitly collected in places where API handlers don't make any use of them. Instead, a separate backplane RPC gathers cluster-wide metrics.

- [#10373](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/10373) Deprecate the trace.payload_encode configuration.
  Add payload_encode=[text,hidden,hex] option when creating a trace via HTTP API.

- [#10381](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/10381) Hide the `auto_subscribe` configuration items so that they can be modified later only through the HTTP API.

- [#10385](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/10385) Hide data items(rule_engine/bridge/authz/authn) from configuration files and documentation.

- [#10391](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/10391) Hide a large number of advanced options to simplify the configuration file.

  That includes `rewrite`, `topic_metric`, `persistent_session_store`, `overload_protection`,
  `flapping_detect`, `conn_congestion`, `stats,auto_subscribe`, `broker_perf`,
  `shared_subscription_group`, `slow_subs`, `ssl_options.user_lookup_fun` and some advance items
  in `node` and `dashboard` section, [#10358](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/10358),
  [#10381](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/10381), [#10385](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/10385).

- [#10404](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/10404) Change the default queue mode for buffer workers to `memory_only`.
  Before this change, the default queue mode was `volatile_offload`.  When under high message rate pressure and when the resource is not keeping up with such rate, the buffer performance degraded a lot due to the constant disk operations.

- [#10140](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/10140) Integrate `Cassandra` into `bridges` as a new backend. At the current stage:
  - Only support Cassandra version 3.x, not yet 4.x.

- [#10143](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/10143) Add `RocketMQ` data integration bridge.

- [#10165](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/10165) Support escaped special characters in InfluxDB data bridge write_syntax.
  This update allows to use escaped special characters in string elements in accordance with InfluxDB line protocol.

- [#10294](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/10294) When configuring a MongoDB bridge, you can now use the ${var} syntax to reference fields in the message payload within the collection field. This enables you to select the collection to insert data into dynamically.

- [#10337](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/10337) Add schema registry feature.

  With schema registry, one can encode and decode special serialization formats in payloads when transforming messages in Rule Engine.  Currently, only [Apache Avro](https://avro.apache.org/) is supported.

- [#10363](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/10363) Implement Microsoft SQL Server bridge.

- [#10573](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/10573) Improved performance of Webhook bridge when using synchronous query mode.
  This also should improve the performance of other bridges when they are configured with no batching.

## Bug Fixes

- [#10145](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/10145) Fix `bridges` API to report error conditions for a failing bridge as
  `status_reason`. Also when creating an alarm for a failing resource we include
  this error condition with the alarm's message.

- [#10172](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/10172) Fix the incorrect default ACL rule, which was:
  ```
  {allow, {username, "^dashboard?"}, subscribe, ["$SYS/#"]}.
  ```

  However, it should use `{re, "^dashboard$"}` to perform a regular expression match:
  ```
  {allow, {username, {re,"^dashboard$"}}, subscribe, ["$SYS/#"]}.
  ```

- [#10174](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/10174) Upgrade library `esockd` from 5.9.4 to 5.9.6.
  Fix an unnecessary error level logging when a connection is closed before proxy protocol header is sent by the proxy.

- [#10195](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/10195) Add labels to API schemas where description contains HTML and breaks formatting of generated documentation otherwise.

- [#10196](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/10196) Use lower-case for schema summaries and descritptions to be used in menu of generated online documentation.

- [#10209](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/10209) Fix bug where a last will testament (LWT) message could be published
  when kicking out a banned client.

- [#10211](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/10211) Hide `broker.broker_perf` config and API documents.
  The two configs `route_lock_type` and `trie_compaction` are rarely used and requires a full cluster restart to take effect. They are not suitable for being exposed to users.
  Detailed changes can be found here: https://gist.github.com/zmstone/01ad5754b9beaeaf3f5b86d14d49a0b7/revisions

- [#10225](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/10225) Allow installing a plugin if its name matches the beginning of another (already installed) plugin name.
  For example: if plugin "emqx_plugin_template_a" is installed, it must not block installing plugin "emqx_plugin_template".

- [#10226](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/10226) Don't crash on validation error in `/bridges` API, return `400` instead.

- [#10242](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/10242) Fixed a log data field name clash.
  Piror to this fix, some debug logs may report a wrong Erlang PID which may affect troubleshooting session takeover issues.

- [#10257](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/10257) Fixed the issue where `auto_observe` was not working in LwM2M Gateway.

  Before the fix, OBSERVE requests were sent without a token, causing failures
  that LwM2M clients could not handle.

  After the fix, LwM2M Gateway can correctly observe the resource list carried by
  client, furthermore, unknown resources will be ignored and printing the following
  warning log:
  ```
  2023-03-28T18:50:27.771123+08:00 [warning] msg: ignore_observer_resource, mfa: emqx_lwm2m_session:observe_object_list/3, line: 522, peername: 127.0.0.1:56830, clientid: testlwm2mclient, object_id: 31024, reason: no_xml_definition
  ```

- [#10286](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/10286) Enhance logging behaviour during boot failure.
  When EMQX fails to start due to corrupted configuration files, excessive logging is eliminated and no crash dump file is generated.

- [#10297](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/10297) Keeps `eval` command backward compatible with v4 by evaluating only Erlang expressions, even on Elixir node. For Elixir expressions, use `eval-ex` command.

- [#10300](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/10300) Fixed an issue where a build made with Elixir could not receive uploaded plugins until the `plugins` folder was created manually to receive the uploaded files.

- [#10315](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/10315) Fix crash checking `limit` and `page` parameters in `/mqtt/delayed/messages` API call.

- [#10317](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/10317) Do not expose listener level authentications before extensive verification.

- [#10323](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/10323) For security reasons, the value of the `password` field in the API examples is replaced with `******`.


- [#10410](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/10410) Fix config check failed when gateways are configured in emqx.conf.
  This issue was first introduced in v5.0.22 via [#10278](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/10278), the boot-time config check was missing.

- [#10449](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/10449) Validate the ssl_options and header configurations when creating authentication http (`authn_http`).
  Prior to this, incorrect `ssl` configuration could result in successful creation but the entire authn being unusable.

- [#10455](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/10455) Fixed an issue that could cause (otherwise harmless) noise in the logs.

  During some particularly slow synchronous calls to bridges, some late replies could be sent to connections processes that were no longer expecting a reply, and then emit an error log like:

  ```
  2023-04-19T18:24:35.350233+00:00 [error] msg: unexpected_info, mfa: emqx_channel:handle_info/2, line: 1278, peername: 172.22.0.1:36384, clientid: caribdis_bench_sub_1137967633_4788, info: {#Ref<0.408802983.1941504010.189402>,{ok,200,[{<<"cache-control">>,<<"max-age=0, ...">>}}
  ```

  Those logs are harmless, but they could flood and worry the users without need.

- [#10548](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/10548) Fixed a race condition in the HTTP driver that would result in an error rather than a retry of the request.
  Related fix in the driver: https://github.com/emqx/ehttpc/pull/45

- [#10201](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/10201) In TDengine, removed the redundant database name from the SQL template.

- [#10270](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/10270) Clickhouse has got a fix that makes the error message better when users click the test button in the settings dialog.

- [#10324](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/10324) Previously, when attempting to reconnect to a misconfigured Clickhouse bridge through the dashboard, users would not receive an error message. This issue is now resolved, and error messages will now be displayed

- [#10438](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/10438) Fix some configuration item terminology errors in the DynamoDB data bridge:

  - Changed `database` to `table`
  - Changed `username` to `aws_access_key_id`
  - Changed `password` to `aws_secret_access_key`
