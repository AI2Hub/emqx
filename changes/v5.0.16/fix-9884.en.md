Fix resource health check process

* Do not resume all buffer workers on successful health check. Previously after a successful healthcheck all buffer workers (for all resources) were resumed

* Do not pass undefined state to resource health check callback. If `on_start` callback never succeeded, the state of the resource is undefined. There is no sense to pass it to `on_get_status` callback.
