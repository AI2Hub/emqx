# v4.4.19

## Enhancements

- Improving error logs related to Proxy Protocol [emqx/esockd#177](https://github.com/emqx/esockd/pull/177).

  The sample logs before this improvement:
  ```
  2023-04-20T14:56:51.671735+08:00 [error] supervisor: 'esockd_connection_sup - <0.2537.0>', errorContext: connection_shutdown, reason: {invalid_proxy_info,<<"f\n">>}, offender: [{pid,<0.3192.0>},{name,connection},{mfargs,{...}}]

  2023-04-20T14:57:01.348275+08:00 [error] supervisor: 'esockd_connection_sup - <0.2537.0>', errorContext: connection_shutdown, reason: {proxy_proto_timeout,5000}, offender: [{pid,<0.3194.0>},{name,connection},{mfargs,{...}}]
  ```
  After the improvement:
  ```
  2023-04-20T18:07:06.180134+08:00 [error] [esockd_proxy_protocol] The listener 127.0.0.1:8883 is working in proxy protocol mode, but received invalid proxy_protocol header, raw_bytes=<<"f\n">>

  2023-04-20T18:10:17.205436+08:00 [error] [esockd_proxy_protocol] The listener 127.0.0.1:8883 is working in proxy protocol mode, but timed out while waiting for proxy_protocol header
  ```

- Adds a new feature to enable partial certificate chain validation for TLS listeners[#10553](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/10553).
  If partial_chain is set to 'true', the last certificate in cacertfile is treated as the terminal of the certificate trust-chain. That is, the TLS handshake does not require full trust-chain, and EMQX will not try to validate the chain all the way up to the root CA.

- Adds a new feature to enable client certificate extended key usage validation for TLS listeners[#10669](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/10669).

## Bug fixes

- Fixed an issue where the rule engine was unable to access variables exported by `FOREACH` in the `DO` clause [#10620](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/10620).

  Given a payload: `{"date": "2023-05-06", "array": ["a"]}`, as well as the following SQL statement:
  ```
  FOREACH payload.date as date, payload.array as elem
  DO date, elem
  FROM "t/#"
  ```
  Prior to the fix, the `date` variable exported by `FOREACH` could not be accessed in the `DO` clause of the above SQL, resulting in the following output for the SQL statement:
  `[{"elem": "a","date": "undefined"}]`.
  After the fix, the output of the SQL statement is: `[{"elem": "a","date": "2023-05-06"}]`
