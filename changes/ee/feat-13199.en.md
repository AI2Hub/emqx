Implemented the Message Enrichment and Transformation feature.

This allows users to transform incoming messages without the need to define SQL rules in the Rule Engine, just by using simple variform syntax.

For example: if we want to take an incoming message encoded as Avro, decode it to JSON and then take the `tenant` client attribute from the publishing client and prefix it to the topic, before processing the result in Rule Engine, one would only need a transformation with the following configuration:

```hocon
message_transformation {
  transformations = [
    {
      name = mytransformation
      enable = true
      failure_action = drop
      payload_decoder = {type = avro, schema = myschema}
      payload_encoder = {type = json}
      operations = [
        {key = "topic", value = "concat([client_attrs.tenant, '/', topic])"}
      ]
    }
  ]
}

```
