Upgrade pulsar client from `0.8.4` to `0.8.5` (see [pulsar#62](https://github.com/emqx/pulsar-client-erl/pull/62).

Prior to this fix, if the producer attempt to contact the client process in certain race conditions, it could stop and not be restarted.  The only workaround would then to manually restart the action.
