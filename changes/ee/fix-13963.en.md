Fixed below bugs of the Audit Log feature:

- The Audit log feature cannot be used with the SSO feature

  Previously, the Audit log feature could not handle SSO events and each event would throw an exception.
  
- Illegal access (for example, a `GET` request to a `POST`-only endpoints) not be logged.
