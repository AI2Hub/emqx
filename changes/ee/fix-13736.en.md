Upgrade Kafka producer to support client re-authentication. See [kafka_protocol#122](https://github.com/kafka4beam/kafka_protocol/pull/122).

Also fixed below minor issuses:

- `unexpected_info` error log in [PR#13727](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/13727) and [wolff#74](https://github.com/kafka4beam/wolff/pull/74).
- `einval` crash report of Kafka connection due to a race condition [kafka_protocol#124](https://github.com/kafka4beam/kafka_protocol/pull/124).
