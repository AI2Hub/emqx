Change Kafka bridge's config `memory_overload_protection` default value from `true` to `false`.
EMQX logs cases when messages get dropped due to overload protection, and this is also reflected in counters.
However, since there is by default no alerting based on the logs and counters,
setting it to `true` may cause messages being dropped without noticing.
At the time being, the better option is to let sysadmin set it explicitly so they are fully aware of the benefits and risks.
