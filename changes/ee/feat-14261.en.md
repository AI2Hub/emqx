Added `tns` (tenant namespace) to `clientid` index to facilitate multi-tenancy.

Starting from 5.9, MQTT clients with a client attribute named `tns` will be considered a multi-tenant client.

A multi-tenant client will automatically get below features:

- Structured logs with `tns` as a metadata field.
- Can be listed from `/api/v5/mt/client_list/:ns` API.
- Included in the per-namepsace client count API `/api/v5/mt/client_count/:ns`

It's worth mentioning that the other two important features for multi-tenancy are already available before 5.9:

- Tenant Topic Isolation: This can be done by making use of the MQTT listener's `mountpoint` config.
- Tenant Client ID Isolation: This can be done by using the `mqtt.clientid_override` config.

Admin multi-tenancy (aka. admin user group) is not yet implemented in this version.
