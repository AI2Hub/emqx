Improve Kafka producer error handling for `message_too_large`.

Prior to this change, Kafka producers would retry sending oversized batches (`message_too_large` error) in hopes of a server side configuration fix (`max.message.bytes`).

Now, oversized messages are automatically split into single-message batches for retry.
If a message still exceeds size limits, it will be dropped to maintain data flow.
