Remove the config `auto_reconnect` from the emqx_authz, emqx_authn and data-bridge componets.
This is because we have another config with similar functions: `resource_opts.auto_restart_interval`ã€‚

The functions of these two config are difficult to distinguish, which will lead to confusion.
After this change, `auto_reconnect` will not be configurable (always be true), and the underlying
drivers that support this config will automatically reconnect the abnormally disconnected
connection every `2s`.

And the config `resource_opts.auto_restart_interval` is still available for user.
It is the time interval that emqx restarts the resource when the connection cannot be
established for some reason.
