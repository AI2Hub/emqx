# v4.4.18

## Enhancements

- Improved the placeholder syntax of the rule engine [#10470](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/10470).

  The parameters of certain actions support using placeholder syntax to dynamically fill in the content of strings. The format of the placeholder syntax is `${key}`.
  Prior to the improvement, the `key` in `${key}` could only contain letters, numbers, and underscores. Now the `key` supports any UTF8 character after the improvement.

- Adds a new feature to enable partial certificate chain validation for TLS listeners[#10553](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/10553).
  If partial_chain is set to 'true', the last certificate in cacertfile is treated as the terminal of the certificate trust-chain. That is, the TLS handshake does not require full trust-chain, and EMQX will not try to validate the chain all the way up to the root CA.
