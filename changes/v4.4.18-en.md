# v4.4.18

## Enhancements

- Improved the placeholder syntax of the rule engine [#10470](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/10470).

  The parameters of certain actions support using placeholder syntax to dynamically fill in the content of strings. The format of the placeholder syntax is `${key}`.
  Prior to the improvement, the `key` in `${key}` could only contain letters, numbers, and underscores. Now the `key` supports any UTF8 character after the improvement.

- Adds a new feature to enable partial certificate chain validation for TLS listeners[#10553](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/10553).
  If TLS listener has `partial_chain` set to `cacert_from_cacertfile`,
  the certificate in the `cacertfile` will be used as the `cacert` for chain path validation. If the `cacertfile` has a chain of certificates, the cert at the end of the file will be used as the `cacert` for path validation.
