This version included a refactoring of MQTT bridge config.
The older version config file created from v5.0.11 or earlier will be converted to
according to the new schema.

Please note, the request body of `/bridges` API to configure MQTT brdige is changed in a incompatible way.

## Enhancements

- Disable global garbage collection by `node.global_gc_interval = disabled` [#9418](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/9418)ã€‚

- Improve the CLI to avoid waste atom table when typing erros [#9416](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/9416).

  Same is done for `/listeners/{listener_id}/authentication/id/...`.

- Add more PSK ciphers support [#9505](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/9505).

- Improve `emqx_retainer` write performance: get rid of transactions on write [#9372](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/9372).
