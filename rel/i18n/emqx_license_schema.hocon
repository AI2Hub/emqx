"""This configuration parameter is designated for the license key and supports two input formats:

- Direct Key: Enter the secret key directly as a string value.
- File Path: Specify the path to a file that contains the secret key. Ensure the path starts with <code>file://</code>.

Note: An invalid license key or an incorrect file path may prevent EMQX from starting successfully.
If a file path is used, EMQX attempts to reload the license key every 2 minutes.
Any failure in reloading the license key will be recorded as an error level log message,
without causing system downtime."""
