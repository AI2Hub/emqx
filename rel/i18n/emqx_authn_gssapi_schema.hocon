        This is typically the network access point of the service, such as the DNS record of the load balancer endpoint.

        Important considerations include:

        - It must match the FQDN used in the server's Kerberos principal, e.g., `mqtt/${SERVER_FQDN}@EXAMPLE.COM`.
        - The client must use this exact value to request authentication services.
